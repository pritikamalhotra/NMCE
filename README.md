This file contains the programs to solve numerical problems of numerical methods of civil engineers.
It contains programs for various methods:
1.  Adam's method
2.  Bisection method
3.  Euler's method
4.  Jacobi's method
5.  Jordan method 
6.  Modified Euler's method
7.  Newton Raphson method
8.  RK method
9.  Seidel
10. Secant

It contains Functions folder.
This folder contains some methods in which some functions are defined. You can use these to test your problems or you can even define your own functions.
After placing NMCE folder at your desired location, 
you can move this Functions folder to /usr/share/octave/4.0.0/m/ location.
This will recognise the functions created automatically and will not create path problems.
